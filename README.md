## About
Work in progress.
The _ease-cpp-skip-list_ library provides an implementation of standard compliant [[*]] ordered associative containers
(map, multimap, set, multiset) based on the [skip list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) data structure.

## Usage

The `ease-skip-list` library is header only, thus to use it, simply copy the files into your project.

## ... 

Note that the `benchmarks/` subdirectory contains benchmarks which were adapted from Google's [_cpp-btree_](http://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/) library.
For convenience (and for now), the subdirectory also includes the _cpp-btree_ library itself.

[*]: Not yet. There are some minor differences.
