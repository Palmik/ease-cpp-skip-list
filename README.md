The `ease-skip-list` library provides implementation of "almost standard complient" containers
(map, multimap, set, multiset) based on the [skip list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) data structure.
The `ease-skip-list` library is header only, thus to use it, simply copy the files into your project.

The `benchmarks/` subdirectory contains benchmarks which were adapted from Google's [`cpp-btree`](http://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/) library.
